# Chordially: Developer blog
#### 12 July 2023

Today, I start developing Chordially - a music player. Why another music player when there are so many out there? Because everyone listens to music differently. I want to make a music player that is tailored to my needs.

### Key selling point
I tend to listen to the same stuff over and over. When YouTube Music tries to recommend songs for me, I don't care for them. I want to listen to songs I want to listen to. This is when songs I've barely heard are the most distasteful to me.

Sometimes, I'm in the mood for songs that I know well. I want to sing along. I want to lip-sync and pretend I'm as talented as Seulgi. Other times, I want something in the background. Something not jarring. And this is when those unfamiliar songs can pop in safely, and if I like them, I can let them stick around.

From time to time, I even want to listen to a specific song. However, I don't want to discard my entire playlist! I often want to simply insert the song into the playlist and then continue listening to it. I also want a quick way to change the next song that plays. I find that on YouTube Music, I just keep swiping to remove songs until the end. I always want the option to choose from multiple songs: my favourite song, a song that I've heard more recently, a song that I often hear after the previous song, etc. And again, I don't want to discard my entire playlist just to insert a song.

### The Process
A music app is not easy to make: many considerations. Of course, I don't have the means to make a streaming service as that will cost licensing fees that I can't possibly recoup. The workaround, then, is to make an offline music app the old-fashioned way: by reading the music files from the user's device. Even with this out the way, there is a lot to consider here. Let me break it down into bite-sized pieces, and hopefully after enough development time, I will have myself an app.

1. Write user stories for Chordially.
2. Design the UI.
3. Design the code structure.
4. Write the code.

### Writing the code
Let's also break this down into iterations.

- [ ] Read music files from the device.
- [ ] Display the music files in a list.
- [ ] Implement playing a single song
- [ ] Implement duplicate song
- [ ] Implement playback controls
- [ ] Implement playing a playlist
- [ ] Implement playing a playlist on shuffle
- [ ] Implement adding a new song to the library
- [ ] Implement song search
- [ ] Plan song metadata needed
- [ ] Implement song metadata
- [ ] Implement primary, secondary, tertiary music rating
- [ ] Implement start page
- [ ] Implement song reordering via drag and drop
- [ ] Implement smart ordering of songs
- [ ] Implement song scoring based on user behaviour
- [ ] Implement next song adding
- [ ] Implement next song smart choice generator
- [ ] Implement learning from user behaviour

### Timeframe
I'm not sure how long this will take. I'm not sure how much time I can devote to this. Thus, it will be a best effort. This dev blog is meant to help with the progress. I will likely work in half-hour increments and share updates here.
